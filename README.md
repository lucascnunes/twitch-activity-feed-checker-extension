I'm still in search for the content of a Twitch Activity Feed Pop-up html content so I can properly anchor the "mark".

The project is already working using a mock up that I've made of the activity feed, but I just need to set up the anchor to the correct div class/id and the correct identification for each alert to make it persistent using local storage, that way even refreshing the page won't "reset" the marked alerts.

If you're a twitch content creator feel free to send me a html file of your Twitch Activity Feed Pop-up so I can set the extension up ðŸ˜…
